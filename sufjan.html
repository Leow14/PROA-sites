            Letra:<br>
            Spirit of my silence I can hear you, but I'm afraid to be near you<br>
            And I don't know where to begin<br>
            And I don't know where to begin<br>
            Somewhere in the desert there's a forest, and an acre before us<br>
            But I don't know where to begin<br>
            But I don't know where to begin<br>
            Again I lost my strength completely, oh be near me tired old mare<br>
            With the wind in your hair<br>
            Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?<br>
            Well I suppose a friend is a friend<br>
            And we all know how this will end<br>
            Chimney swift that finds me be my keeper, silhouette of the cedar<br>
            What is that song you sing for the dead<br>
            What is that song you sing for the dead<br>
            I see the signal searchlight strike me, in the window of my room<br>
            Well I got nothing to prove<br>
            Well I got nothing to prove<br>
            I forgive you mother I can hear you, and I long to be near you<br>
            But every road leads to an end<br>
            Yes every road leads to an end<br>
            Your apparition passes through me, in the willows and five red hens<br>
            You'll never see us again<br>
            You'll never see us again<br>

        <p>
            The evil it spread like a fever ahead<br>
It was night when you died, my firefly<br>
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?<br>
Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?<br>
Well you do enough talk<br>
My little hawk, why do you cry?<br>
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?<br>
Or the Fourth of July?<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head<br>
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High<br>
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction<br>
Now, where am I?<br>
My fading supply<br>
Did you get enough love, my little dove<br>
Why do you cry?<br>
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best<br>
Though it never felt right<br>
My little Versailles<br>
The hospital asked should the body be cast<br>
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky<br>
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth<br>
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?<br>
Shall we look at the moon, my little loon<br>
Why do you cry?<br>
Make the most of your life, while it is rife<br>
While it is light<br>
Well you do enough talk<br>
My little hawk, why do you cry?<br>
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?<br>
Or the Fourth of July?<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>
We're all gonna die<br>

        <p>
            I should have known better<br>
            To see what I could see<br>
            My black shroud<br>
            Holding down my feelings<br>
            A pillar for my enemies<br>
            I should have wrote a letter<br>
            And grieve what I happen to grieve<br>
            My black shroud<br>
            I never trust my feelings<br>
            I waited for the remedy<br>
            When I was three, three maybe four<br>
            She left us at that video store<br>
            Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy<br>
            Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy<br>
            I'm light as a feather<br>
            I'm bright as the Oregon breeze<br>
            My black shroud<br>
            Frightened by my feelings<br>
            I only want to be a relief<br>
            No, I'm not a go-getter<br>
            The demon had a spell on me<br>
            My black shroud<br>
            Captain of my feelings<br>
            The only thing I want to believe<br>
            When I was three, and free to explore<br>
            I saw her face on the back of the door<br>
            Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy<br>
            Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy<br>
            I should have known better<br>
            Nothing can be changed<br>
            The past is still the past<br>
            The bridge to nowhere<br>
            I should have wrote a letter<br>
            Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling<br>
            Don't back down, concentrate on seeing<br>
            The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting<br>
            My brother had a daughter<br>
            The beauty that she brings, illumination<br>
            Don't back down, there is nothing left<br>
            The breakers in the bar, no reason to live<br>
            I'm a fool in the fetter<br>
            Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me<br>
            Don't back down, nothing can be changed<br>
            Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor<br>
            My brother had a daughter<br>
            The beauty that she brings, illumination, illumination<br>
