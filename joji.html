Letra:<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
When I'm gone, when I'm gone<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
When I'm gone, when I'm gone<br>
Swing around front, let me inside<br>
Playin' my song into my sides<br>
It hurts, I can't lie<br>
Remember those times I fought to get out?<br>
I want to get out<br>
Those pictures so clear, the fade in my mind<br>
You leavin' me here with ashes and fire<br>
These people don't heal, these people don't feel<br>
These people aren't real, so make me this deal<br>
Won't you?<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
When I'm gone, when I'm gone<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love<br>
When I'm gone, when I'm gone<br>
Look into your heart and let me know<br>
Do things turn black and gray as they go?<br>
When I'm far too gone, can you show me love? (Ooh)<br>
Give me love (ooh)<br>
Caught in a river of records and dreams<br>
Oh, will you keep up with me?<br>
Everyone's looking for someone to hold<br>
But I can't let you go<br>

    When I was a young boy living in the city<br>
    All I did was run, run, run, run, run<br>
    Staring at the lights, they look so pretty<br>
    Momma said, "Son, son, son, son, son"<br>
    "You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old"<br>
    "All that glitters don't turn to gold"<br>
    "But until then, just have your fun"<br>
    "Boy, run, run, run, run, run"<br>
    Yeah, run, run, run<br>
    Run, run, run<br>
    When I was a young kid living in the city<br>
    All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay<br>
    And every single dime that good Lord gave me<br>
    I could make it last three, four, five days<br>
    Living it up but living down low<br>
    Chasing that luck before I get old<br>
    And looking back, oh, we had some fun<br>
    Boy, run, run, run, run, run<br>
    They tell you that the sky might fall<br>
    They'll say that you might lose it all<br>
    So I run until I hit that wall<br>
    Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun and run, run, run<br>
    Yeah, one day well the sky might fall<br>
    Yeah, one day I could lose it all<br>
    So I run until I hit that wall<br>
    If I learned one lesson, count your blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun and run, run, run<br>
    Run, run, run<br>
    Didn't get everything that I wanted<br>
    But I got what I need, yeah, yeah<br>
    I see that light in the morning<br>
    Shining down on me<br>
    So take me up high, take me down low<br>
    Where it all ends nobody knows<br>
    But until then let's have some fun<br>
    Yeah, run, run, run, run, run<br>
    They tell you that the sky might fall<br>
    They'll say that you might lose it all<br>
    So I run until I hit that wall<br>
    Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun and run, run, run<br>
    Yeah, one day well the sky might fall<br>
    Yeah, one day I could lose it all<br>
    So I run until I hit that wall<br>
    If I learned one lesson, count your blessings<br>

    Run, run, run<br>
    Yeah, run, run, run<br>
    Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun<br>
    Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun<br>
    Yeah, if I learned one lesson, count your blessings<br>
    Look to the rising sun, yeah, run, run, run<br>
