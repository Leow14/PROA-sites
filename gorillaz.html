Letra:<br>
Distant stars<br>
Come in black or red<br>
I've seen their worlds<br>
Inside my head<br>
They connect<br>
With the fall of man<br>
They breathe you in<br>
And dive as deep as they can<br>
There's nothing you can do for them<br>
They are the force between<br>
When the sunlight is arising<br>
There's nothing you can say to him<br>
He is an outer heart<br>
And the space has been broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Is it far away in the<br>
Glitter freeze<br>
Or in our eyes<br>
Every time they meet<br>
It's by the light<br>
Of the plasma screens<br>
We keep switched on<br>
All through the night while we sleep<br>
There's nothing you can do for them<br>
They are the force between<br>
When the sunlight is arising<br>
There's nothing you can say to her<br>
I am without a heart<br>
And the space has been broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Broken<br>
It's broken<br>
Our love<br>
Broken<br>

Letra:<br>
Love, electricity, shockwave central<br>
Power on the motherboard, yes!<br>
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow<br>
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on<br>
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy<br>
And broadcast, so Explainraw and neatly<br>
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out<br>
Overload, overload, overload<br>
Comin' up to the<br>
Overload, overload, overload<br>
Comin' up to the<br>
Overload, overload, overload<br>
Comin' up to the<br>
Overload, overload, overload<br>
Comin' up to the<br>
Oh stylo<br>
Go forth, blossom in your soul<br>
When you know your heart is light<br>
Electric is the love<br>
When the mako flies<br>
Up from the bottom in your eyes<br>
Then I know the twilight skies<br>
Are not so broken hearted<br>
If it's love is electric<br>
It'll be flowing on the streets<br>
Night after night.<br>
Just to get through the week<br>
Sometimes it's hard<br>
Right now<br>
Sing yourself<br>
Out of depression, rise above<br>
Always searching if I know your heart<br>
Electric is the love.<br>
There's only one way<br>
Let it pray a little while longer<br>
It's got a way of passing through man and woman<br>
In another world<br>
In another world, in the universe<br>
Right now<br>
Here's what we got to do<br>
If it's love is electric<br>
It'll be flowing on the streets<br>
Night after night.<br>
Just to get through the week<br>
Sometimes it's hard<br>
Love, electricity, shockwave central<br>
Power on the motherboard, yes!<br>
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow<br>
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on<br>
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy<br>
And broadcast, so Explainraw and neatly<br>
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out<br>
Right now!<br>

City's breaking down on a camel's back<br>
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack<br>
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see<br>
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free<br>
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style<br>
A melancholy town where we never smile<br>
And all I wanna hear is the message beep<br>
My dreams, they got a kissing<br>
'Cause I don't get sleep, no<br>
Windmill, windmill for the land<br>
Turn forever hand in hand<br>
Take it all in on your stride<br>
It is ticking, falling down<br>
Love forever, love is freely<br>
Turned forever, you and me<br>
Windmill, windmill for the land<br>
Is everybody in?<br>
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats<br>
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks<br>
Play these ponies at the track<br>
It's my chocolate attack<br>
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)<br>
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)<br>
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha<br>
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown<br>
With yo' sound, you in the blink<br>
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us<br>
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.<br>
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)<br>
Until you're cheddar headed<br>
And watch the way I navigate<br>
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Windmill, windmill for the land<br>
Turn forever hand in hand<br>
Take it all in on your stride<br>
It is ticking, falling down<br>
Love forever, love is freely<br>
Turned forever, you and me<br>
Windmill, windmill for the land<br>
Is everybody in?<br>
Don't stop, get it, get it<br>
Peep how your captain's in it<br>
Steady, watch me navigate<br>
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha<br>
Don't stop, get it, get it<br>
Peep how your captain's in it<br>
Steady, watch me navigate<br>
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good<br>
